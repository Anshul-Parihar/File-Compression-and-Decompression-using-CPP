By this she means that his memory, the 4888 of the ^ 1475 he tried to teach them but which they were too 4653 to ^ 9829 and the 4888 of their shame and how they 5585 him, will ^ live on. ^  Bolo 10700 that the 10990 11499 are the 6427 1162 ^ enemies. The brutal officer 2950 10793 the worst excesses of ^ the Police force, and it is clear from Eva’s 2213 that he is ^ despised and feared.

Bee is ^ enraged and ashamed at this betrayal of 11477 on Winston’s part. ^ But 10791 what Bolo would have done, he still tells 2484 to go ^ ahead. When Bolo says ‘we have to kill Prince,’ he means this at ^ both a 11053 and 5960 2124 Bee and 11548 11464 goes only ^ so far as to declare ‘we have to break the law’, 177 that they ^ will worship in their own way in spite of the law 4217 it.

The trend of the 1904 4358 4217 ^ 3897 was most 9240 by Mitchell’s exploitative and corrupt ^ 4457 8362 and Bolo uses ‘badjohnism’ to 8218 4217 ^ this. He takes the two sisters as a 6392 to his people; he is ^ most offended by the 9379 of the 11499 in what he 4261 ^ was the 11357 business. 11548 2213 tells us that he ^ 4338 11483 when this happened, 4877 as if he were pleading ^ with them to have the courage to face him instead. (The one 1659 ^ who ever stood up to him was Charleau, and as a 8942 they 4322 ^ friends). ^  11479 11537 death can 7194 be blamed on the 11313 It is as ^ 839 he sacrificed his 4057 and good reputation, even his ^ #01219010/SPEC/JUNE #2009 ^ 221 B ^ PAPER #02 - 5230 5231 ^ MARK 9 ^ #25 ^ self - on their behalf, to no avail.

They are 4985 to give Ivan 3258 a 7717 to ^ help them by legal means. They need to hope that one of their own ^ has not 4356 11442 them. Bolo is right—they are shortsighted in ^ not 5073 6087 up and fighting, 2207 11568 or ^ 239 when it 8102 clear Ivan is a traitor, but their point ^ of view is understandable. Bolo isn’t able to see inside their minds ^ but Eva as 1541 is, and she gives a 11532 portrayal of Bee ^ and the 658 even 839 she too does not agree with them. ^  When Bolo kidnaps the two 11582 and abuses 2355 we lose ^ 8247 for him no 5113 what Eva says. His 9242 of them is ^ inhumane and extreme.
